              With a rich tapestry of experience that spans over 15 years in the vibrant 
              world of hospitality, I have mastered the art of service, attention to detail, 
              and the nuanced art of customer satisfaction. Transitioning from orchestrating 
              memorable guest experiences, I embraced the realm of education, spending a year 
              imparting knowledge and nurturing minds as a teacher. My journey has now taken 
              an exciting turn into the technological domain, where I am channeling my passion 
              for learning and problem-solving into programming. This latest chapter is not 
              just a career shiftâ€”it&apos;s a synthesis of my dedication to growth, my love for challenge, 
              and my commitment to lifelong learning </p>
